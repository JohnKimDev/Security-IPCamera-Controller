This is a PHP proxy script for IP Camera controller.

* Pan control
* Scan control
* Save multiple camera image
* Custom Message on a camera image
* Date/Time Stamp on a camera image
* Design to fit best for IPhone/IPod 

==================================================================================================================

For the first release, the code is designed to fit best for iphone/ipod devices. 

I wrote this script to check my home security IP Cameras when I am on the road.
I could just open the IP cameras' ports to public and access the ip cameras directly 
but then it will be too risky to have anyone in the world have access directly to the cameras. 
The IP cameara has own very basic login system, but it is very easily break into. 
In addition, I have multiple security cameras and I only have one dynamic IP at home. 
Plus, the camera sends a 640x480 image which is too big for an iphone/ipod device.
Iphone's 3G data stream was too weak for smooth mjpg. 

Solution:
I wrote this proxy script to dynamically resize the IP camera's images and add custom 
text & time stamp on fly. You can also easily control Camera's Pan & Scan. And with one click
button, you can save the multiple images.

With simple code change, the script should work with any IP camera but one I use is this one.

Note: With this script alone does NOT have any web security function. I use this scipt with apache & SSL Certification 
access control. Future update will focus on the web access security.
